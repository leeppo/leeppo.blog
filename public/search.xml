    <title>Líføy the fox spirit</title>
    <url>/2020/04/17/Lifoy-the-fox-spirit/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I’m glad to present you my OC :3 Her name is Líføy.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4NOeEZQ.png" alt="Lifoy"><br><a id="more"></a><br>She is a fox spirit, like Kitsune, but more similar to Fylgja in North mythology, cause she has bounded to her world (like original Fylgja bounded to family) to protect it. But one time she wanted to take a journey with her sister Sôwili (literally not, because spirits don’t have family like humans, but that’s most accurate definition of their relationships) and to do that, she needs to born in physical foxgirl form. Since that time she has traveled through universe to feed her curiosity and help everyone who needs it on her way. But sometimes, she has to take care of the world under her (not only her, in this case, she’s a part of a team of spirits) protection. But in physical form it may be more difficult than she thought.</p>
<p>She likes: tea, rain, look at the stars, cooking, play games (any games literally), sleep.</p>
<p>She doesn’t like: make plans, math, big slugs.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>That is my favorite anime past few years.</p>
<p>I love nature, I love camping so much. In my childhood every year me and my parents was going camping at river or in forest. Today we trying to going to nature every year too, but  in a more comfortable way (but I keep dreaming to going camping with tents next year haha). So Yuru Camp reminds me how beautiful and cozy may be days when you don’t mind all your problems and just relaxing at nature.</p>

    <url>/2020/02/23/See-you-space-cowboy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Cowboy Bebop is the best anime ever for me, without a doubt. It has magnificent soundtrack, excellent story-line and marvelous blues atmosphere. I have watched it 8 or 9 times, I know it by heart. But I’m ready to return to it again and again. Seriously, I can say many many good things about this anime, but if you have never seen it - just watch it.<br>Here is Spike Spiegel. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly &lt;3<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BYOhffw.png" alt="Spike Spiegel"><br><a id="more"></a><br>This artwork is the first one with recorded painting process, soo speedpaint will be available soon on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3I5S1lU4W1sWMRzub01Aw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youtube channel</a>.<br>Also, I have question for you: do I need to post tools and time that I’ve spent to each artwork?</p>

    <title>Rain in the City</title>
    <url>/2020/02/07/Rain-in-the-City/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Rain is peace. More, than anything else in this universe..<br><img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/024/033/156/original/leksi-reppo-rainy2.gif" alt="Rain"><br><a id="more"></a><br>I found a strange bug in @aseprite<br> with exporting gif.<br>This glitching colours  &gt;.&lt;<br>Looks weird, isn’t it?<br>This morning I’ve spent plenty hours to deal with my gif but ouch. No way. So I’ve exported pngs from sprite and then convert them to giv via ezgif (ツ) </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mO6Kjmk.gif" alt="Rain"><br>But some hours ago I’ve found an excellent CLI tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/kornelski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kornelski</a>: <a href="https://gif.ski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gif.ski</a><br>It can create an awesome gifs in seconds by simple command from your pngs. And it’s Opensource!<br>Check the difference.<br>But in twitter Aseprite devs reported that it’s bug under development last weeks. So I’m looking forward to the patch.</p>
<p>Also, with this artwork tied an emotional thing, that I’ve found time ago..</p>
<p>From all my life I’ve got one important thing:<br>In everyhard situation you basically have only two choices. First one - keep going. Second - you can stop and leave the game. But on the back end - you have no choice. Because leaving won’t change anything for you.<br>Yes, whatever you do, some things can’t be changed. Never. In both ways. But one of the way keeps chance for you to change your mind. Another - don’t.<br>And there is one more thing. Past has less pain than present. Always.<br>Once, I has come to the edge.. I was in the depression, I was devastated.. I was in the shower and crying. Tears fell on my face, mixed with water jets and left me.. nothing. No relief, no emotions. Pointless like my existence.<br>In this moment I have found answer to question: “What I can do with all this shit?”. Nothing.. I can do nothing. Like this tears.. I can’t change anything in that situation to fix some things and my emotions. So I just need to take it behind me and just keep going. With all this stuff and pain in my heart I just need to make steps on my life. For no reason. Why I’ve need that? That is the key. I didn’t need that because of anyone else but me. In a world, where you lost your raison d’étre - you also lost all your fears. You don’t fear death, failures, illness, loneliness anymore. And at this stage every moment of your life got unique taste. You can watch how your life passes by, you can do something new, that you never does before, or you can just skip day by day. It changes  your mind. And it gives you a chance to find new raison d’etre in some time. Also that give you peace. Strange, with smack of ashes, but, yep, peace.<br>Here is the reason.<br>So, everyone who feels that his life reach it’s end - keep going. Just keep going. In a moment, where you deal with fact that you can’t change anything - you’ll find peace and time to get one’s breath. And then, one time, one day, may be, you’ll found new reasons to make your life colorful again.<br>Only you can figure it out.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>He’s currently name is MrP, but I’m not sure that would be final version. Another variant, that i have in my mind: The scarecrow. But this name sounds like a cliche.<br><img src="https://mir-cdn.behance.net/v1/rendition/project_modules/1400_opt_1/4f546a81205353.5cf81f0b43bc4.png" alt="MrP"><br><a id="more"></a><br><img src="https://mir-cdn.behance.net/v1/rendition/project_modules/2800_opt_1/0e143b81205353.5cf81f0b43fc5.png" alt="MrP"><br>A little backstory:<br>He’s a keeper, i.e. gatekeeper at the gate between the worlds of dreams. He’s not good,and not evil, he have got his own goals.<br>Technically - MrP is a spirit. He haven’t got physical body and he live in dreams (like Ole Lukøje) but can use things as avatar (he more often use scarecrow for this). I think he is very powerful spirit, but he don’t like to interfere in the affairs of peoples or other spirits and creatures. He’s a watcher and a wanderer. No one knows where and how he was born, but as gatekeeper he guard other worlds for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>A big post about him will be on my Patreon page next month.</p>

    <title>Simple pixel animated characters</title>
    <url>/2019/05/12/Simple-pixel-animated-characters/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This bg and characters I have made for one simple game.<br><img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/017/870/269/original/lexi-reppo-ani3.gif" alt="Animated pixelart characters"><br><a id="more"></a><br>It was interesting project: I found that make low-res pixel characters is more harder, than hi-res. In that situation you need to find the right way and vision to show the idea in limited room for manoeuvre. Thus you need to rethink your habits and vision. It was very interesting and good experience for me.</p>

<p>I wanted to draw pixel-style art long time ago. And now, with my new galaxy note I have time to do it. Because now I can draw anywhere: in bed, in transport, in toliet, finally xD<br>Aaaand i have found this experience awesome. There is no constant pain:”How I can do this better?” No. only relax, fun and exploration in colour world. I think it is beginning of new journey for me.<br>Let’s see how it will go on.<br>Also, guy here - McCree from Overwatch :3 </p>

    <title>Instead preface</title>
    <url>/2019/03/11/Instead-preface/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sorry, today I wrote this post only in Russian, but some time later I will upgrade it :3</p>
<p>Однажды давным давно был (и есть сейчас) такой сервис как дайрики - кто слышал вспомнит, кто нет - и ненужно вам оно. Суть в том, что в свое время долгие годы своей совсем-совсем юной молодости я вела там дневник. Не блог, как сегодня принятно, куда сливаются четко выверенные посты, призванные привлечь максимальное число клиентов, а именно дневник - куда сливалось все: и глупые юношеские переживания и первые попытки осмыслить этот мир.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Так вот. Недавно, в очередной раз, я его откопала. И знаете ли - это крайне увлекательное занятие - вспоминать себя на 10-15 лет моложе. О, это крайне эмоциональный экспириенс, чего уж там. Ловишь двойное фаталити: от того что вспоминаешь себя тогда, все свои эмоции, все свои переживания, и от того, что вспоминаешь свои представления и ожидания касательно будущего и на секунду ухватываешь восприятие с точки зрения той себя на себя нынешнюю.<br>Крайне занимательно.<br>И думаю, что данный блог будет в немалой степени посвящен именно этому: течению моей жизни. Я буду рада, если кто-то прочерпнет из моего опыта что-то полезное, что-то, чем можно отбиться от вездесущих граблей, поджидающих нас на каждом углу. Но в первую очередь это будет блог ради себя. Или ради тех, кто однажды захочет узнать - кем я была.<br>И - спасибо. Всем, кто был здесь.</p>

    <title>Home alone</title>
    <url>/2019/03/11/Home-alone/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last 3 days I have stayed alone at home. After a half-year with my girlfriend i feel so lonely :/ But there are no reasons for deep sadness. We will meet again after 2 weeks. One more bad thing: i got a flu :( For now - I am spending all time on painting and trying to get well.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Also, i have found nice TV series: “agents of S.H.I.E.L.D”. Yep, it isn’t new, but I’m not a TV addict, so.. anyway, Phil Coulson is amazing :3 may be some time later I will paint artwork about S.H.I.E.L.D team. If you have any ideas like: “Hmmm, what about a nice meeting at the shawarma after battle, like in post title scene in Avengers” - you are welcome in comments :3</p>

<p>I love Helsinki too much. I feel at peace, when I’m here.<br>It was hard to save gradients look at 8 bit color depth. And because of artstation compression - some gradient banding still here :C</p>
